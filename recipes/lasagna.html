      <li>1 pound hot Italian sausage</li>

        and beef and use a wooden spoon to break the meat up into pieces.

        minutes.

      <li>
        Add garlic and cook for 1 minute, or until fragrant. Add in the onion
        and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, for 6 to 8 minutes, or
        until onion has softened and is almost translucent. Stir in the tomato
        paste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add in the wine and stir to combine. Cook for 5 minutes. Then stir in
        the stock and crushed tomatoes, stirring well to combine. Bring sauce to
        a boil, then reduce to medium low and continue cooking for at least 40
        minutes.

        Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil. Add a pinch of salt, then
        add in the lasagna noodles. Cook for 4 minutes, then use tongs to remove
        the noodles, placing them side by side on the prepared parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>

      <li>
        Pour 1 cup of meat sauce on the bottom of the casserole dish. Then layer
        5 noodles on top of the sauce. Top with 3/4 cup of the ricotta filling,
        1 and 1/2 cups of the sauce, and 1/4 cup of the parmesan cheese. Repeat
