    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 400Â° F.</li>
      <li>
        Place the potatoes in a large bowl. Toss with vegetable oil. Sprinkle in
        1/2 tablespoon seasoning, toss well to coat.
      </li>
      <li>
        On 2 baking sheets, lay fries out in a single layer (not touching).
        Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 tablespoon (more or less to taste) over
        fries.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for approximately 40 minutes, flip fries half way through. I also
        rotated the baking sheets, top to bottom and bottom to top.
