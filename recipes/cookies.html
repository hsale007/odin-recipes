    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      I like cookies. I eat alot of cookies. Maybe too many. But cookies makes
      me happy. I will keep eating cookies
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 cups (380 grams) all-purpose flour**</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
      <li>
        2 sticks (227 grams) unsalted butter, at cool room temperature (67°F)
      </li>
      <li>1/2 cup (100 grams) granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cups (247 grams) lightly packed light brown sugar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons vanilla</li>
      <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
      <li>2 cups (340 grams) semisweet chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350ºF. Line baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
      <li>In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
      <li>
        In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the butter, granulated sugar, and
        brown sugar until creamy, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides and
        bottom of the mixing bowl. Add the vanilla and eggs and beat until
        combined, scraping the bowl down as needed. Gradually beat in the flour
        mixture. Stir in the chocolate chips.
      </li>
      <li>
        If time permits, wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least
        24 hours but no more than 72 hours. This allows the dough to “marinate”
        and makes the cookies thicker, chewier, and more flavorful. Let dough
        sit at room temperature just until it is soft enough to scoop.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide the dough into 3-tablespoon sized balls using a large cookie
        scoop and drop onto prepared baking sheets.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for 11-13 minutes, or until golden brown. Cool for 5 minutes before
        removing to wire racks to cool completely.
      </li>
      <li>
        Although I prefer cookies fresh from the oven, these can be stored in an
        airtight container for up to 3 days. See post for storage tips.
